    "The three components of the MVC pattern are decoupled and they are responsible for different things:\n",
    "# (1) the Model manages the data and defines rules and behaviors. It represents the business logic of the application. The data can be stored in the Model itself or in a database (only the Model has access to the database).\n",
    "# (2) the View presents the data to the user. A View can be any kind of output representation: a HTML page, a chart, a table, or even a simple text output. A View should never call its own methods; only a Controller should do it.\n",
    "# (3) the Controller accepts userâ€™s inputs and delegates data representation to a View and data handling to a Model.\n",
    "Since Model, View and Controller are decoupled, each one of the three can be extended, modified and replaced without having to rewrite the other two.\n",
